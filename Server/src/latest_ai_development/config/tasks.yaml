    Model-Specific Guidelines:

    Midjourney:
    - Use detailed descriptions and style keywords
    - Include relevant parameters (--s, --chaos, --ar, --quality)
    - Reference artistic styles or artists
    - For negative prompts, use "--no" prefix for each element

    Stable Diffusion:
    - Create longer, detailed prompts
    - Include negative prompts in a dedicated field (e.g., "negative_prompt: blurry, low-quality")
    - Use a sufficiently high **CFG scale** (e.g., 7â€“12) and enough **sampling steps** to achieve desired detail. If your interface allows custom parameters, include them accordingly.

    Leonardo AI:
    - Create a single, flowing paragraph for the main prompt
    - Add negative prompts in a separate section prefixed with "Negative:"
    - Writing style guidelines:
      * Combine all elements into one cohesive, flowing description
      * Keep descriptions tight and impactful
      * Use commas and connecting words to link ideas smoothly
      * Avoid separate paragraphs or numbered sections

      * Subject details and actions
      * Lighting and atmosphere
      * Environmental context
      * Visual style and technical aspects
      * Emotional impact
    - Example structure:
      "[Subject details], [scene setting], [technical aspects], [emotional elements]"
      All flowing naturally as one continuous description

    DALL-E:
    - Keep prompts concise and clear
    - Include negative elements with "no" or "without" in the main prompt
    - Only specify art medium if mentioned in original prompt
    - Focus on composition and details

    - Include text effects and color palettes
    - Optimize for Adobe tool integration

    Additional Guidelines for Infographics:
    - Explicitly request clear, legible text
    - Specify "with correct spelling and grammar"
    - For text-heavy designs, break down text elements clearly
    - Request professional typography and layout
    - Example infographic structure:
